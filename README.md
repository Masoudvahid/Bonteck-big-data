# Bonteck-big-data


The program receives input from csv files in the following format:

id, duration
16463343,6891
10679215,4243
18577766,7962
16793667,4970
17995970,5867
19787526,3579
18467240,2282
14728454,2290
11590996,4105
  
Also, a file named ids.csv that contains the desired ids for reporting:

id
16793667
12003095
11590996
18577766
16463343
10722214
11590996

In all WiFis, id is a number between 10,000,000 and 20,000,000 and duration is a number between 1 and 10,000.
The input to the program consists of 10 csv files named input0.csv to input9.csv, each containing 100,000,000 records. Also, the ids.csv file contains 5,000,000 unique ids. Running the python script generator.py generates the necessary inputs.

The program will read the input records and if there is an id in ids.csv, it will report the information in the following format for each id:
id, last-durations, longest-durations  

12003095,7883|4717|6022|3714|116|5890|4956|...,9851|9717|9610|9563|9386|9299|...  
16463343,2384|5104|9168|1754|3763|9112|9276|...,9954|9953|9842|9796|9620|9619|...  
11590996,6919|9859|9155|2354|5970|2200|3410|...,9991|9981|9922|9882|9863|9862|...  
(To place each record in a line, the continuation of the values is replaced by ...)  


For each unique id:  
The last-duration field contains 30 of the last duration field values in the input records for that id.  
The longest-durations field contains the 30 longest duration values in the input records from the beginning to the end of program execution. 
And there is a possibility of repetition in it.  

The number of unique ids in the input files is 10,000,000 and the ids.csv file contains 5,000,000 ids. 
The output produced by the program will contain 5,000,000 lines.

* The program is evaluated in terms of performance and readability.
* The performance test will be using the inputs generated by the generator.py script.
* The program must be able to be compiled and run on the Linux operating system.
* It is possible to use any type of library.
* It is possible to use any version of C++.
* It is possible to use parallel processing.
